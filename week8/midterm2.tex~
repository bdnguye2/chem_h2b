1. (4 pts) \textbf{Van't Hoff Equation} In a decomposition reaction, the nitrosyl chloride
ClNO(g) decomposes into NO(g) and Cl$_2$(g).
\begin{center}
  \ce{2 ClNO(g) <=> 2 NO(g) + Cl$_2$(g)}
\end{center}
Using the Van't Hoff equation
\begin{equation}
  \ln K = -\frac{\Delta H^\circ}{RT} + \frac{\Delta S^\circ}{R}
  \label{eqn:van_hoff}
\end{equation}
and the gas phase thermochemistry data, determine the following. Report
all results to 3 significant figures.

(a) Temperature at which the equilibrium constant $K_p$ is greater than 1.

(b) At 300K, suppose the reaction is at equilibrium and suddenly, the temperature
is increased. Describe the ``driving force'' in terms of the thermodynamic
quantities.

    Cl$_2$    &  0.00 & 223.08

2. \textbf{Mixing of Ideal Gas} Assume ideal gas conditions. At 298.15K, equal
amounts of nitrogen dioxide NO$_2$(g) and dinitrogen tetraoxide N$_2$O$_4$(g) are
separated into equal volumes $V$, see Fig. \ref{fig:mix}. The initial pressures of the
NO$_2$(g) and N$_2$O$_4$(g) are 
The valve is then opened allowing the gases to mix.
Report results to 2 significant figures.

\end{figure}

(a) Determine the free energy of mixing $\Delta G_\text{mix}$.

(b) N$_2$O$_4$(g) is known to decomposes into NO$_2$(g). Write the balanced
chemical equation including states.
