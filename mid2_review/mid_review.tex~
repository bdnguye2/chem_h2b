\maketitle

This is a checklist based on the lecture and textbook materials. It is not
expected to be an all encompassing study guide and provides a guideline for
your studies.

\begin{itemize}
\item Review real-world applications (lecture, quiz and textbook materials)
\item[] \textbf{Entropy and 2nd Law of Thermodynamics}
\item Quantify irreversibility/``quality loss'' of energy
\item $\Delta S = \frac{Q_\text{rev}}{T}$
\item Clausius Inequality
\item Entropy dependence on
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Temperature
  \item Volume and pressure (Ideal Gas)
  \end{itemize}
\item 3rd Law of Thermodynamics
\item Gibbs-Duhem Equation
\item Equilibrium and thermodynamic potentials - $S(U,V)$ is maximal,
  $U(S,V)$ and $H(S,P)$ are minimal
\item Gibbs free energy $G = H - TS$
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Spontaneity
  \item Exergonic and endergonic
  \item Free energies of reaction $\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$
  \item Temperature dependence - enthalpy and entropy driven
  \item Pressure dependence $G(P) = G^\circ + nRT\ln\frac{P}{P^\circ}$
  \item Ideal gas mixtures
  \end{itemize}
\item[] \textbf{Chemical Equilibrium}
\item Free energy of mixture vary with composition for all states
  $G_i = G_i^\circ + n_iRT\ln a_i$ where $a_i$ is activity (dimensionless)
\item Relating reaction quotient $Q$ and free energy $\Delta G$
\item Law of Mass Action
\item Properties of equilibrium constants
\item Direction of reaction and ``driving force'' in terms of thermodynamic
  quantities
\item[] \textbf{Statistical Thermodynamics}
\item Microstates and macrostates
\item Boltzmann statistics $S = k_b\ln W$
\item Estimating entropy changes in chemical reactions
\item Equipartition Theorem - In thermal equilibrium, the average energy per
  quadratic degree of freedom in the energy is $\frac{1}{2}k_bT$
\end{itemize}
