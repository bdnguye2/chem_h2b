\maketitle

Collaborations are encouraged and students must report all collaborators
on each assignment. All external sources (websites, books) must be
cited. An \textit{extra credit} (\textit{EC}) problem will be available per
assignment. Please submit a completed homework on-time to receive \textit{EC}
and no partial \textit{EC} (all parts must be correct) will be given out.
Additional problems are listed at the end of each assignment. This week's
assignment is due \textit{Tuesday, March 8th at 2:00pm.}

1. (4 pts) \textbf{Phase Diagram} The phase diagram for carbon is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:carb}.
Answer the following questions:

(a) At 3000K, what is the minimum pressure needed before graphite changes into
diamond?

(b) What is the minimum temperature at which liquid carbon exist at pressures
below 10,000 atm?

(c) Based on the phase diagram, are diamonds stable under normal conditions e.g.
1 atm and room temperature? If not, why are people able to wear diamonds without
keeping them under high pressure?

2. (2 pts) \textbf{Vapor Pressure}

3. (4 pts) \textbf{Clausius--Clapeyron Equation} The Clausius--Clapeyron equation
relates the vapor pressure and temperature of the system given by
\begin{equation}
  P_f = P_i e^{-\frac{\Delta H^\circ_\text{vap}}{R}(\frac{1}{T_2}-\frac{1}{T_1})}
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the vapor pressure, $T$ is the temperature, and $\Delta H^\circ_\text{vap}$
is the enthalpy of vaporization.

(a) At ground level, the vapor pressure of water at 80$^\circ$C is 355.26 Torr.
Determine the $\Delta H^\circ_\text{vap}$ for water. \textit{Hint: What is the
  vapor pressure of water at $100^\circ$C?}

(b) Using the $\Delta H^\circ_\text{vap}$ in part (a), determine the amount of energy
needed to heat 1 L of water from $10^\circ$C to $120^\circ$C? Heat capcities of liquid
water and water vapor are 4.184 J/(g $^\circ$C) and 1.996 J/(g $^\circ$C), respectively.

4. (4 pts) \textbf{Revisited Barometric Formula}

\vspace{3in}

5. (4 pts) \textbf{Real Gases} The Van der Waals equation extends the ideal gas equation to
include the effects of interaction between molecules of a gas given by
\begin{equation}
  (P+\frac{a}{v^2})(v - b) = RT
  \label{eqn:van_der}
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the pressure, $v$ is the molar volume, $a$ and $b$ are constants accounting
for the non-ideality of the gas.

(a) 

(b) 

6. (2 pts) \textbf{Van der Waals Constants $a$ and $b$} In eqn. \ref{eqn:van_der}, the constants
$a$ and $b$ may be viewed as corrections to the ideal gas. $a$ accounts for the strength
of attractions between its component molecules whereas $b$ considers the finite volume
that the molecule occupies.
