\maketitle

Collaborations are encouraged and students must report all collaborators
on each assignment. All external sources (websites, books) must be
cited. An \textit{extra credit} (\textit{EC}) problem will be available per
assignment. Please submit a completed homework on-time to receive \textit{EC}
and no partial \textit{EC} (all parts must be correct) will be given out.
Additional problems are listed at the end of each assignment. This week's
assignment is due \textit{Monday, March 14th at 10:30am.}

1. \textbf{Concentrations of Solutions} An car antifreeze mixture is made by mixing
equal volumes of ethylene glycol (d = 1.114 g/mL, molar mass 62.07 g/mol) and water
(d = 1.000 g/mL) at 20.0$^\circ$C. The density of the solution is 1.070 g/mL. Determine
the mass percent, molarity, molality, and mole fraction.
