\maketitle

Weekly homework assignments are posted approximately one week prior to the
due date. Collaborations are encouraged and students must report all collaborators
in writing on each assignment. All external sources (websites, books) must be
properly cited. Additional problems are listed at the end of each assignment.
This week's assignment is due \textit{Tuesday, Feb 1st at 10:00am.}

\textbf{Hess's Law}

1. (4 pts) Calculate the reaction enthalpy for the formation of anhydrous aluminum
bromide,
\begin{quote}
2 Al(s) + 3 Br$_2$(l) $\rightarrow$ 2 AlBr$_3$(s),
\end{quote}
from the following data:
\begin{quote}
2 Al(s) + 6 HBr(aq) $\rightarrow$ 2 AlBr$_3$(aq) + 3 H$_2$(g)  $\Delta H^\circ = - 1061\text{kJ}$

HBr(g) $\rightarrow$ HBr(aq) $\Delta H^\circ = -81.15\text{kJ}$

H$_2$(g) + Br$_2$(l) $\rightarrow$ 2 HBr(g) $\Delta H^\circ = -72.80\text{kJ}$

AlBr$_3$ $\rightarrow$ AlBr$_3$(aq) $\Delta H^\circ = -368\text{kJ}$
\end{quote}

%2. \textbf{Born--Haber Cycle} (6 pts) Ionic solids are extremely stable and lattice energy
%is an additional energy contribution to the overall stability. However, the lattice
%energy cannot be measured directly. The Born--Haber cycle uses the Hess's Law and allows us
%to compute the lattice energies of an ionic compound. The cycle is sketched for NaCl,
%\begin{center}

%\end{center}
%
%This involves sublimation energy, dissociation energy, ionization energy,
%and electron affinity. The sum of these processes yields the lattice energy. Repeat
%this for cesium oxide (Cs$_2$O).
%
%(a) Draw the Born--Haber cycle.
%
%(b) Look up the enthalpy for the various processes (remember to cite) and calculate
%the lattice energy of Cs$_2$O. Write all thermochemical equations for each step.

\textbf{Entropy}

2. (2 pts) Calculate the change in entropy when the volume of 2.00 mol Ar(g) is increased
from 5.00 L to 10.00 L while the temperature increases from 100. K to 300. K. Assume
ideal behavior. Molar heat capacity at constant volume of Ar(g) is 12.47 J/(K mol).
Report to 3 significant figures.

3. (4 pts) Consider the decomposition of NO$_2$ into nitric oxide and oxygen,
\begin{center}
  2 NO$_2$(g) $\rightarrow$ 2 NO(g) + O$_2$(g).
\end{center}
Given the enthalpy of formation. Report all results to 4 significant figures.

\begin{table}[hbpt]
  \caption{Standard enthalpy of formation ($\Delta H^\circ_f$)
    in kJ/mol}

  \begin{tabular}{c|c}
    Molecule & $\Delta H^\circ_f$ \\
    \hline
    NO$_2$(g) & 33.18  \\
    NO(g)     & 90.29
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

(a) Calculate the enthalpy of reaction ($\Delta H_r$) for the decomposition of NO$_2$(g).

(b) The entropy of reaction ($\Delta S_r$) is $146.4$ J/(mol K), determine at what temperature
is the reaction spontaneous.

%3. (4 pts) Without performing any calculations, predict whether there is an increase or
%decrease in entropy for each of the following processes:
%
%(a) Cl$_2$(g) + H$_2$O(l) $\rightarrow$ HCl(aq) + HClO(aq)
%
%(b) SO$_2$(g) + Br$_2$(g) + 2 H$_2$O(l) $\rightarrow$ H$_2$SO$_4$(aq) + 2 HBr(aq)
%
%(c) NaCl(s) $\rightarrow$ NaCl(aq)
%
%(d) Cu$_3$(PO$_4$)$_2$(s) $\rightarrow$ 3 Cu$^{2+}$(aq) + 2 PO$_4^{3-}$(aq)
%
%\vspace{1in}
%
%4. The following is a molecular visulization of a system undergoing a spontaneous
%change. Determine from the picture whether entropy increases or decreases during the
%process. Account for the spontaneity of the process in terms of the entropy changes
%in the system and the surroundings. The therometers show the temperature of the
%system.
