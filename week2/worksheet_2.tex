\maketitle

Weekly homework assignments are posted approximately one week prior to the
due date. Collaborations are encouraged and students must report all collaborators
in writing on each assignment. All external sources (websites, books) must be
properly cited. Additional problems are listed at the end of each assignment.
This week's assignment is due \textit{Tuesday, Jan 18th at 10:00am.}

\textbf{First Law of Thermodynamics}

1. (3 pts) Below there are pictures showing a molecular view of a system
undergoing a change at constant temperature. In each case, predict the signs
of $q$ and $w$ for each process. Explain what is happening to the system.

2. (4 pts) Calculate the work for each of the following processes beginning with a gas
sample in a piston assembly with $T=305\text{K}$, $P=1.79\text{atm}$, and
$V=52.9\text{L}$ by two different pathways.

(a) Isothermal, reversible expansion to a final volume of $6.52\text{L}$.

(b) Irreversible expansion against a constant external pressure of $1.00\text{atm}$
to a final volume of $6.52\text{L}$.

\textbf{Enthalpy $\Delta H$}

3. Carbon disulfide can be prepared from coke (an impure form of carbon) and
elemental sulfur

\begin{center}
  4 C(s) + S$_8$(s) $\rightarrow$ 4 CS$_2$(l) \, $\Delta H_r = +358.8\text{kJ}$.
\end{center}

(a) How much heat is absorbed in the reaction of $1.25\text{mol}$ S$_8$?

(b) Calculate the heat absorbed in the reaction of $197\text{g}$ of carbon
with an excess of sulfur.

(c) If the heat absorbed in the reaction was $415\text{kJ}$, how much of CS$_2$
was produced?

4. Calculate the heat generated by a reaction mixture of $13.4\text{L}$ of SO$_2$
at $1.00\text{atm}$ and $273\text{K}$ and $15.0\text{g}$ of oxygen in the reaction

\begin{center}
  2 SO$_2$(g) + O$_2$(g) $\rightarrow$ 2 SO$_3$(g) \, $\Delta H_r = -198\text{kJ}$.
\end{center}
