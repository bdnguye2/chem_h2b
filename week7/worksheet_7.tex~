\maketitle

Collaborations are encouraged and students must report all collaborators
on each assignment. All external sources (websites, books) must be
cited. An \textit{extra credit} (\textit{EC}) problem will be available per
assignment. Please submit a completed homework on-time to receive \textit{EC}
and no partial \textit{EC} (all parts must be correct) will be given out.
Additional problems are listed at the end of each assignment. This week's
assignment is due \textit{Tuesday, Feb 15th at 10:00am.}

1. \textbf{Entropy} The following is a molecular visulization of a system undergoing a spontaneous
change. Determine from the picture whether entropy increases or decreases during the
process. Account for the spontaneity of the process in terms of the entropy changes
in the system and the surroundings. The therometers show the temperature of the
system.

4. \textbf{Decomposition Reaction}

\begin{center}
  (NH$_4$)$_2$Cr$_2$O$_7$(s) $\rightarrow$ Cr$_2$O$_3$(s) + N$_2$(g) + NH$_3$(g)
  + O$_2$(g) + H$_2$O(g)
\end{center}

(a) Balance the chemical reaction.

5. \textbf{Air Pollutants} Sulfur trioxide SO$_3$ and nitrogen oxide NO can react in
the atmosphere as follows:
\begin{center}
  SO$_3$(g) + NO(g) $\rightarrow$ SO$_2$(g) + NO(g).
\end{center}
(a) Predict the effect of the following changes to the amount of NO$_2$ when the reacton
has come to equilibrium in a stainless steel bulb equipped with entrants for chemicals
\begin{enumerate}
\item the amount of NO increases
\item the SO$_2$ is removed by condensation
\item the pressure is tripled by pumping in helium
\end{enumerate}

(b) Given that a certan temprature $K = 6.0\times 10^3$, calculate the amount (in moles)
of NO that must be added to a $1.00$ L vesssel containing 0.245 mol SO$_3$(g) to form
0.240 mol SO$_2$(g) at equilibrium.
